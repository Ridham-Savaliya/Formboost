      <h2>The Evolution of Form Building in 2024</h2>
      <p>In the digital age, your website's forms are more than just data collection points; they are the bridge between you and your customers. Choosing the right form builder can be the difference between a bounce and a conversion.</p>
      
      <h3>1. FormBoom: The New Standard for Developers</h3>
      <p>FormBoom has quickly risen to the top of the list for teams who need power without complexity. With its unique focus on automation and developer-friendly integrations, it offers features that others charge hundreds for.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Instant Telegram/Slack alerts, zero-lag builder, visual analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Startups, developers, and agile marketing teams.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Typeform: The UI Pioneer</h3>
      <p>Typeform remains a strong contender with its "one question at a time" approach. However, for many small businesses, the pricing has become restrictive.</p>

      <h3>3. Jotform: The Template Giant</h3>
      <p>If you need a specific template for a niche industry, Jotform likely has it. But the interface can feel dated compared to modern tools like FormBoom.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>While industry giants have their place, new contenders like FormBoom are offering more value, faster performance, and better modern integrations for free.</p>

      <h2>Why the Shift is Happening</h2>
      <p>For years, Typeform was the go-to for beautiful forms. But as we move into 2024, teams are demanding more than just beauty—they need speed and deep automation.</p>

      <h3>Pricing Comparison</h3>
      <p>Typeform's free tier is notoriously limited. FormBoom, on the other hand, allows up to 500 submissions on its free plan, making it the obvious choice for growing startups.</p>

      <h3>Automation & Webhooks</h3>
      <p>While Typeform requires complex Zaps for basic tasks, FormBoom has native Telegram, Slack, and Discord integrations built directly into the dashboard. No third-party tools needed.</p>

      <h3>Step 1: Setting up your FormBoom form</h3>
      <p>Create your contact form in the FormBoom dashboard. Our visual builder ensures all fields are validated and optimized for conversion.</p>

      <h3>Step 2: Configuring the Webhook</h3>
